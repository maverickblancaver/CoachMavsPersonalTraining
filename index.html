        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I’ve been physically active since childhood, and my passion for teaching grew even stronger during my two-year missionary service. Helping others learn and grow was an incredibly fulfilling experience, and I hoped to continue teaching—this time, in something I was deeply passionate about: fitness.  
            When I returned home, people began asking me how to start their fitness journey, but I wasn’t sure how to guide them. That all changed when a gym owner reached out to me with an unexpected opportunity—to become a personal trainer. Without hesitation, I accepted the offer. They handed me a textbook on personal training, and I dedicated myself to studying it, completing it within three months. But I knew I needed more.  
            Determined to improve, I enrolled in the Gold’s Gym Fitness Instructor's Course. Through hard work and dedication, I successfully completed and passed the program. The experience taught me invaluable lessons, but I knew this was just the beginning.  
            This journey isn’t just about getting certified—it’s about growth, mastery, and making a real impact. I will continue to expand my knowledge, pursue higher professional certifications, and refine my skills. My mission is clear: to help others become the strongest, healthiest versions of themselves.</p>
